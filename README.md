_It is possible to program the accuracy of rounding. Enter 0.x0, where x0 is accuracy. As a rounding function, a standard Round () is used._

> "if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0, and round(1.5) is 2)")

_For example, 0.00 will round up to 2 marks after the comma; 0. only integers will be considered._
